            <p>The virus that causes COVID-19 is mainly transmitted through droplets generated when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or exhales. These droplets are too heavy to hang in the air, and quickly fall on floors or surfaces.
                You can be infected by breathing in the virus if you are within close proximity of someone who has COVID-19, or by touching a contaminated surface and then your eyes, nose or mouth.</p>

        <aside id="sidebar"> <!--some content aside from the content it is placed in(like side chick)-->
            <p>For starters, if you are currently COVID-positive, you should not get the vaccine until you are fully recovered. Even if the infection was mild or asymptomatic, it is important to wait for at least 10-14 days since your symptoms first appeared before you go out to get the vaccine jab</p>
